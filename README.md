# Face Recognition Attendance System

## Overview
This project is a Facial Biometric Attendance System designed for real-time and efficient attendance tracking. The system integrates advanced face recognition algorithms and edge computing, using RetinaFace, MTCNN, OpenCV, PyTorch, and Jetson Nano for high-performance face detection and recognition. It effectively manages a 500-person facial database, deployed across campus and endorsed by college authorities.

## Features
- **Automated Attendance Tracking**: Uses facial recognition to streamline attendance management.
- **Advanced Face Detection**: Implements RetinaFace and MTCNN for high-accuracy detection.
- **Edge Computing**: Utilizes Jetson Nano for real-time, on-device processing.
- **Database Integration**: Efficiently manages a 500-person facial database.
- **Network Camera Support**: Works with campus-wide surveillance cameras.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: C++, Python, PHP
- **Face Recognition**: RetinaFace, MTCNN, OpenCV, PyTorch
- **Hardware**: Jetson Nano
- **Database & Storage**: PHP & Custom Storage Solutions
